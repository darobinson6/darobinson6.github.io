My GitHub account is simple, I used my personal email and a simple username with has my name in it. 
I created a simple repository, named darobinson6.github.io.
 To clone it I went to the repository I wanted to clone, chose a location  on my computer I wanted it to be in which for me was CTI-110 folder, clicked "clone repository" and commit my changes by writing a summary and clicking commit.
